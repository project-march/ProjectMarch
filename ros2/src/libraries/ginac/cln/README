Features:
- Rich set of number classes:
  Integer (unlimited precision), rational, short float, 
  single float, double float, long float (unlimited 
  precision), complex, modular integer, univariate polynomial.
- Elementary, logical, transcendental functions.
- C++ as implementation language brings
    - efficiency,
    - type safety,
    - algebraic syntax.
- Memory efficiency:
    - Small integers and short floats are immediate,
      not heap allocated.
    - Automatic, non-interruptive garbage collection.
- Speed efficiency:
    - Assembly language kernel for some CPUs,
    - Karatsuba and Sch√∂nhage-Strassen multiplication.
- Interoperability:
    - Garbage collection with no burden on
      the main application,
    - hooks for memory allocation.

Requires: C++ compiler g++.
The following C++ features are used:
classes, member functions, overloading of functions and operators,

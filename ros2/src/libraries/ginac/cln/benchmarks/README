Bench1 is a benchmark for the transcendental functions I found on the LiDIA
home page.

Some of its tests are not good because they fall into pitfalls of some systems
(for example exp(log(2)) is not a good test because in CLN, exp(x) begins
by computing x mod log(2)). Also it fails to benchmark the most basic
operations: multiplication and division.

Bench2 is a benchmark jointly designed by the LiDIA and CLN developers to
overcome these flaws.

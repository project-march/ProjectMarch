Using the gait generator
========================

.. inclusion-introduction-start

This tutorial will teach how to use the March gait generator to create your own gaits and subgaits.

The Basics
^^^^^^^^^^
When starting up the gait generator, a number of graphs are opened.
Each graph represents a single joint of the exoskeleton and displays the trajectory for that joint.

.. tip::
  If you want to change the amount of joints you are working with,
  edit the ``<robot>.xacro`` specified in the `launch file <march_rqt_gait_generator/launch/march_rqt_gait_generator.launch>`

On the y-axes of the graphs the joint angles in degrees are shown. On the x-axes the time in seconds is shown.
The trajectory is defined by several setpoints which are shown as small red circles.
By changing the values of the setpoints, the trajectory can be adjusted.

You can change the values in the table by just clicking on the specific box in the table and adjust the value.
Alternatively, the time and position of a setpoint can be changed by dragging the setpoint within the graph with your mouse.

To add a new setpoint, simply click on the graph.
If you hold ``Ctrl`` while clicking, the new setpoint gets interpolated on the existing trajectory.
To delete a setpoint you have to click on the setpoint that you want to delete while pressing ``Shift``.

Preview
^^^^^^^
On the right side of the screen, a visualization of the exoskeleton is shown.
A preview of the gait that you are generating in the gait generator is shown here.
You can play the preview by clicking on the ``start`` button and stop the preview by clicking on the ``stop`` button.
By adjusting the value of 100, you can change the speed at which the preview is shown.
The speed is defined as a percentage of the actual speed.

Duration
^^^^^^^^
In the bottom right of the gait generator it is possible to change the duration of the gait file.
By ticking the box ``Scale Setpoints``, you can scale all the setpoints to the new duration of the gait, so that the relative amount of time between the setpoints will stay the same.
Without ticking this box the total amount of time of the gait will change without changing the absolute amount of time between setpoints.
This means, when decreasing the total amount of time it is possible that some last setpoints will be deleted as they exceed the new duration.
When this happens, a warning will be given by the gait generator.

.. tip::

  Mirroring is not exclusive to gaits and joints with ``left`` or ``right``, you can set custom keys in the settings menu bottom right.

Import/Export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The structure for storing gait files is explained in :ref:`march-gait-files-label`.

To export a subgait file, choose a directory where you want to store your subgait.
The directory you choose has to be a level higher than the gait folder.
So choose for example 'airgait' as a directory.
You can save the gait files by clicking on the button ``export`` in the gait generator.
A file can be imported by pressing the ``import`` button and selecting the file.

Invert gait
^^^^^^^^^^^
Invert the time axis of the gait, i.e. the gait is played from the back to the front.

Foot height and heel-heel distance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are three information boxes in the gait generator: two foot height boxes and the heel-heel distance.

The foot height boxes can be used to estimate how high the exo will step, for example when making a stairs or a rough
terrain gait. Height left foot shows the height of the left foot, assuming the right foot is flat on the ground.
Similarly for the height of the right foot. The will be a bit counterintuitive as it does not match with what is shown
in the preview. The reason for this is that the backpack will usually not be completely vertical like it is in
the preview. Assuming flatness of the feet on the ground is a better approximation in this case (not perfect either!).

The heel-heel distance is the distance between the feet *in the x-z plane*. The y-axis is disregarded. Here the z-axis
goes up, the x-axis is the walking direction and the y-axis points from foot to foot (when standing). This feature can
be useful in estimating step size.

Velocity and Max Effort Plot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The velocity plot plots the velocity from axis -max_velocity to max_velocity. The blue dotted line is the zero line.
If the velocity comes near the top or the bottom of the graph, the gait will probably not be followed very well,
because the `safety controller <https://wiki.ros.org/pr2_controller_manager/safety_limits/>`_ will prevent the joints
from rotating that quickly.

The max effort plot shows how much effort the
`safety controller <https://wiki.ros.org/pr2_controller_manager/safety_limits/>`_ will allow at any point in time.
The axis is -max_effort to max_effort. This plot contains two lines, one for the maximum negative effort, and one for
the maximum positive effort. If your gait does not approach either the max velocity or the soft limits, the lines will
be constant at -max_effort and +max_effort at the top and bottom of your graph respectively.

If a joint comes close to the max_velocity you will see peaks in your max_effort plot. If you joint exceeds the
max_velocity, the peaks will cross the zero line. This means that the safety controller will apply a minimal effort to
slow the joint down. Exactly how high a peak can be without causing problems depends on how heavy the gait is (but zero
crossing almost never work). You will have to test this in practice or ask Control.

Gait type
^^^^^^^^^
The gait type determines what tuning will be used in the gain scheduling of this gait.

Mirroring
^^^^^^^^^
The feature called mirroring allows you to mirror a gait. This means, for the mirrored gait the trajectories of the left and right joints are switched.
One requirement to do this is that the last setpoint of the left leg has to have the same values as the first setpoint of the right leg and the other way around.
Otherwise, the gait generator will give you a warning that gait mirroring is not possible. Furthermore, either the
word ‘left’ or ‘right’ should be in the name of the subgait.
The mirrored version will be saved with the same version name as the original file, but the word ‘left’ or ‘right’ in the subgait folder is changed to the opposite one.

Publish
^^^^^^^
The ``publish`` button allows you to directly publish the subgait you made on a custom topic.

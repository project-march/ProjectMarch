## About
Project MARCH is a student team of the TU Delft that is involved in the development of
a user-friendly and versatile exoskeleton, a motorized robotic suit, that can be used
to get people with a spinal cord injury to stand up and walk again. This repository
contains the code to make this happen.

More information about our project can be found on [projectmarch.nl](https://www.projectmarch.nl/en/project-march).

## Framework
All code is built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS). More information about ROS can be found on https://www.ros.org/about-ros/.

## Installation and usage
- To install required ROS enviroment, please follow the [Install ROS and tools](https://docs.projectmarch.nl/doc/getting_started/install_ros_and_tools.html) instructions.
- To build and run the code, please follow the [Setup your workspace](https://docs.projectmarch.nl/doc/getting_started/setup_your_workspace.html) instructions.

## Documentation

# GitLab defines different job types, depending on how the job is scheduled.
# Right now, we use two types: 1) branches and 2) merge_requests.
#
# 1) Branches
# Pipelines labeled "branches" are executed on the latest commit of a branch. All
# jobs that are scheduled conditionally based on the file changes in the
# latest commit (the "changes" keyword,
# see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#onlychangesexceptchanges)
#
# 2) Merge requests
# Pipelines labeled "merge_requests" are executed when commits are pushed to a
# merge request. This pipeline runs on the difference between the target branch
# and the source branch. The "changes" keywords covers ALL changes that differ
# between the two branches.
#
# In short: branches        = only latest commit
#           merge_requests  = all commits in in merge request
#
# An overview of all the different types can be
# found on https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#onlyexcept-basic

# These following jobs are so called "hidden jobs"
#   (see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#hide-jobs). 
# These jobs are not actually used here, but used in other jobs with the help of
# the "extends" keyword (sort of like #include or import, 
#   see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#extends)
# They are used to extract statements that are included in almost every job, to
# prevent duplication.

# Only run when the pipeline is for a branch that does not start with some digits
# followed by a `-`, i.e. all branches that are not created via issues.

# Allow each branch to run their own container. This allows a branch to add
# dependencies to their package.xml and use them as expected. This process works as
# follows:
# 1. If an image with the tag of the current branch is not available, the base image
#   is pulled and tagged as the image for this branch.
# 2. If there are changes to the Dockerfile or to a package.xml file, rebuild the
#   container. This will use remote caches from GitLab to speed up the process.

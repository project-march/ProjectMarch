How to use the Makefile
-----------------------

LATEX, BIBTEX, DVIPS, RM, GZIP and UUENCODE are configuration
variables which you can change to point to the appropriate
location on your system. You do not need to change anything else.

    `make binsplit.dvi' creates binsplit.dvi

    `make binsplit.ps' creates binsplit.ps

    `make clean' removes all files produced by LaTeX and BibTeX 

Do not type the quotes!

Prerequisites.
=============

C++11-compliant C++ compiler. GNU C++ compiler (version >= 4.8.1) is recommend.
Non-GNU compilers might not work at the moment.

GNU multiprecision library (http://gmplib.org), version > 4.0.

[Optional] To build CLN documentation texinfo and TeX are necessary.

If you install CLN from git, you also need 

git itself (http://git-scm.com), version >= 1.5.0
GNU autoconf (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf), version >= 2.63
GNU libtool  (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool), version >= 1.5
GNU automake (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake), version >= 1.11

Installation from a source .tar.bz2 distribution.
================================================

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
[ become root if necessary ]
# make install

To build the manual in PDF, HTML, or PostScript formats, use one of

$ make pdf
$ make html
$ make ps

To compile and run CLN's test suite and check whether the library was
compiled correctly you can use

$ make check

The "configure" script can be given a number of options to enable and
disable various features. Most useful ones are:

--prefix=DIR

Install CLN into the directory DIR (default: /usr/local).

--with-gmp

Use GNU multiprecision library (default: yes, if available)

--disable-static

Don't build static version of CLN library. This option is useful if
want to reduce the build time (and you don't need the static library).

For a complete list, run:

$ ./configure --help


Installation from git.
=====================

1. Download the code.

Initial download:

$ git clone git://www.ginac.de/cln.git

Later on you can update your copy with

$ git pull

2. Make sure all required software is installed. This is *really*
important step. If some package is missing, the ‘configure’ script might
be misgenerated,

3. Run

$ ./autogen.sh

to generate the ‘configure’ script, and proceed in a standard way, i.e.

$ ./configure
$ make
[become root if necessary]
# make install

On some platforms (arm, hppa, sparc), problems with the assembler routines
have been reported. It may be best to add "-DNO_ASM" to CPPFLAGS before
configuring:

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DNO_ASM

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the documentation,
in the doc/ directory.

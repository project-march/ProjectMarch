    """This method is made to load in subdirectories with their files extensions.

    The data_files are required in the format of tuples (install_path, source_path).
    With install_path referencing to the generated folder in 'install/[package_name]',
    and the source_path referencing to the path the files are currently (pre_build) located.

    Important:
        **This method doesn't work for more than 1 level deep.**

    Example:
        ```
        data_files = [
        ('share/ament_index/resource_index/packages', ['resource/' + package_name]),
        ('share/' + package_name, ['package.xml']),

        ]`

        **data_files.extend(copy_subdir("config", '*', package_name))**
        ```

    How it works:
        If this method is called with `copy_subdir('config', '*.yaml')`,
        it will load in all files located in '`pwd`/config/[folders]/[file_names].yaml'
        into '[project_dir]/install/[package_name]/share/[package_name]/config/[folders]/[file_names].yaml'

    Args:
        dir_path (str): The directory from package level you want to copy over, e.g. 'config'.
        file_extension (str): The types of files it needs to copy over, e.g. '*.yaml'.
            You can also do '*' to copy over all types of files.
        package_name (str): The name of the package, e.g. 'march_utility'.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[str, List[str]]]. A list of tuple of the format (build_folder_name, [files_copied_to_this_folder]).

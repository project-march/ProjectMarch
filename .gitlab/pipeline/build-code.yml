# Build code stage #
####################
# Run the build command to see if everything compiles without errors. This is a
# separate stage for the noetic and for the foxy code, because they are not dependent
# on each other and can therefore be run in parallel.
# Besides compiling, this also produces a "compile_commands.json" file that is used
# by subsequent C++ static analysis stages.

# The following two hidden jobs are used to reduce duplication because these rules are
# almost the same for a lot of subsequent jobs. They only vary in a few ways, which is why
# some variables are introduced. The following three variables change, depending on the
# version of ROS:
#   1. ROS_VERSION, either 'ros1' or 'ros2'
#   2. ROS_CODENAME, either 'noetic' or 'foxy'
#   3. DOCKER_FILE, the path of the Dockerfile that defines the execution environment. This
#      points to a ROS1 and ROS2 specific Dockerfile
.base_builder:
  stage: Build code
  # Depending on the rules below, `TAG` has a different value.
  # In most cases, this will just be `main`, unless the Dockerfile has
  # changed.

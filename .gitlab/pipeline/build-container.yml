# Build container stage #
#########################
# This stage builds Docker containers when a new dependency has been added or when
# a new linter is installed. These stages will almost never run, unless
# certain files have been changed.

# This is a "hidden" stage that is not run by itself. It is run extended by other
# stages that define different values for the variables. This avoids duplication.

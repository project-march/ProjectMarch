ros_control
===========
`ros_control <https://wiki.ros.org/ros_control>`_ is a set of packages to use/write different controllers and
write a hardware interface to interface the ROS framework with your robot hardware. ros_control has already created
some standard controllers, for example, a position controller and an effort controller. These are implemented in
`ros_controllers <https://wiki.ros.org/ros_controllers>`_.

The hardware interface for the |march| is contained in
:hardware-interface:`march_hardware_interface </march_hardware_interface>` package.
See also the :ref:`march-hardware-interface-label` page.
